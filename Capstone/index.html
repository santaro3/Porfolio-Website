		<h3>Revolutionizing Residential Heating and Cooling Systems</h3>
		<p>The Intelligent IoT HVAC Control System project is the capstone project completed by Sean Santarossa and Eric Parker for their final year at the University of Windsor is an all-in-one solution
			for modernizing current conventional residential heating and cooling systems. Before an introduction to the solution done by the team, it is best to introduce the problem. The goal of the Intelligent HVAC IoT Control System capstone project was to solve a very common problem experienced in many residential buildings: poor heat distribution. For example, it is very common for the ambient temperature of the basement of homes to be considerably colder than that on higher levels due to the fact that warm air tends to rise. this effect is illustrated in the figure below. </p>
			<img src="images/capstone-1.jpg">
	</div>

	<div class="content-wrapper">
			<p>One solution to this problem is to deploy an approach known as HVAC zoning. A zoned heating and cooling system divides a home into different areas (called zones) that are each controlled separately by their own thermostat. For example, a homeowner might install separate thermostats in the basement, main level, and upstairs allowing the central forced air system to use feedback from each of the thermostats to determine when and to which zones to supply heat. However, as described previously, the central forced air system is only capable of operating in two states: on or off. Thus, how is it possible to use the temperature information collected from each zone to independently control the temperature of each? The solution is dampers. Dampers are electronically controlled variable valves that control the flow of heated or cooled air throughout a home. Shown in the Figure below is a typical zoning configuration installed in a central forced air system with the dampers highlighted in red.</p>
			<img id="conventional-hetaing" src="images/capstone-2.png">
			<p>Zoning systems are traditionally implemented by installing dampers directly in the air ducts just as the system shown in the Figure above illustrates. There are a few major problems with this approach, namely the fact that the damper installation procedure is very expensive and invasive, and the user is limited to the number of zones that they install (for example, installing three dampers allows for a maximum of three independently controlled zones).
			The main objective of this capstone project was to provide an effective and economical implementation of zone temperature control that is dynamic, extensible, and noninvasive to address the issues currently experienced with traditional zoning systems.</p>

<!-- High-Level Overview -->
<section class="light" >
	<h1> High Level Overview</h1>
	<div class="high-level-overview">
		<p> To achieve the objective of providing a zoned temperature control system that is dynamic, extensible, and noninvasive, the team had to develop an entirely new approach to zoning. 
			The result of this new approach and equivalent modelling is that the dampers used in modern zoning systems can be placed anywhere along the path of heat transfer for a given zone. The team’s solution then is to move the damper out of the ducts and in to the vents. Since the relative position of the damper in each zone has no effect on the resulting flow, this paradigm shift is theoretically sound and provides a competitive advantage over traditional systems since the need for an expensive and invasive installation is completely eliminated.
		</p>
		
		<div id="list-wrapper">
			<p>To implement this system the team chose to use three hardware units:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Main Hub Thermostat</li>
			<li>Room Temperature Sensor</li>
			<li>Smart Vent</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		
		<p>Each of these units communicates with one another using a propietary 2.4GHz protocol developed by the team. The main hub thermostat unit functions as the central control unit for all devices on the wireless network. It is an internet-connected thermostat capable of receiving temperature data from all zones, using the data to make intelligent decisions about how heat should be distributed, and issuing resulting commands to dampers in each zone. </p>
		<p>The room temperature sensor devices are used to monitor the conditions of supplementary zones to the network. An independently controlled zone is created for each room temperature sensor that is added to the network. The units are directly paired with both the main hub thermostat and their respective dampers acting as relay points for information; they measure and send temperature information about their zone to the main hub thermostat and forward control messages from the main hub thermostat to the dampers in their zone to achieve actuation.</p>
		<p>The smart vent devices implement the dampers associated with each zone. These smart vents are paired with a room temperature sensor and function just as a traditional air duct damper does to establish a means of control for a particular zone.</p>
		<a href="images/network-overview.jpg" data-lightbox="high-level-overview"> <img src="images/network-overview.jpg"> </a>
		<p> Shown in the Figure above is a typcal setup for the system. There are three seperate temperature zones created. Zone 1 consistes of the main hub thermostat and a smart vent - directly
			connected to it, Zone 2 and 3 each consist of a room temperature sensor (that communicates its respective temperature reading to the main hub thermostate and listens for commands from the main hub) and smart vents. The result is three independent temperature zones from two room temperature sensors and a main hub thermostat. </p>
		<p> Perhaps the most impressive feature of the system is its extensibility. For example that if the consumer wants to add more zones to this network over time they simply purchase another room 		temperature sensor and a couple more smart vents and pair them to the existing network. This greatly reduces upfront installation costs as the consumer can purchase and create zones over months 	  and years rather than having to purchase the entire system at one time.

<section class="carousel-section dark">
	<h1 id="margin-fix">Main Hub</h1>
	<div class="content-wrapper">
		<p> The main hub thermostat is the central control device in the network, it replaces the thermostat in conventional residential HVAC systems. Its main purpose is 
		to adminstrate the network by communicating with room temperature sensors to determine when to open and close the smart vents distributed throughout the zones. The main hub thermostat
		can be directly controlled using its built in touchscreen or through a custom-built web interface that can be accessed online. From the touchscreen consumers can set the temperature of zones,
		view Wi-Fi settings, calibrate the temperature of thermostat and view the structure of the network/connected devices to view the current temperature of the zones and the battery levels of the devices in each zone. The thermostat builts a graphical representation of the network that updates as more room temperature sensors and smart vents are added, this provides the consumer a top-down view of the entire system. Check out the carousel below to get a close look!

				    <p>The main operational screen displays temperature and control information about each zone including the name, current temperature, and allowable temperature range of the selected zone. The user can change the selected zone by swiping left or right on the screen similar to swiping on an iPhone. As shown in the figure above, a dot appears on the screen for each room temperature sensor that is paired with the main hub thermostat. If an additional room temperature sensor was successfully paired with the main hub thermostat, the user would automatically see another dot appear on this screen and would be able to immediately update the new zone’s information.From the main operational screen, the user can access the settings by tapping the settings button in the top right corner of the screen.

				    <h5>Temperature Calibration</h5>
				    <p>The calibration settings screen allows users to calibrate the temperature sensor corresponding to each zone. This screen is necessary because the LM335 temperature sensors may carry an error of ±3°K. However, the operation of the device remains linear regardless of the residual error. Thus, the calibration screen allows the user to teach the main hub thermostat the exact error value to expect from each respective zone. Following calibration, the main hub stores the error for each zone and compensates all further readings by offsetting the measured temperature values by the appropriate residual error ultimately resulting in very accurate temperature control.</p>

If the user sees that the battery symbol for a particular device is drawn in the colour red, it means the batteries in the device is getting close to dying and the user should replace the batteries at their earliest convenience.</p>

		<p>The primary functionalities of the room temperature sensor devices are to pair with the main hub thermostat to establish an independently controlled zone, pair with smart vents that are going to be installed in its respective zone, regularly provide updates about the temperature conditions in the zone to the main hub thermostat, and relay command signals from the main hub thermostat to its vents as required. The finished design of the room temperature sensor is shown in the Figure above.
		These devices essentially act as the managers of a designated zone by relaying information between the main hub thermostat and the vents associated with the zone.</p>

		<p> The primary functionality of the smart vent devices is to implement the dampers associated with each zone. These smart vents are actuated (open and closed) using a 3.3V servo motor and is given
			commands to open or close wirelessly from the main temperature thermostat indirectly through the room temperature sensors (or directly from the main temperature thermostat if the smart vents
			are in the same zone as the main hub thermostat). These smart vents are inserted directly into the vents already installed in houses to provide the retrofit and non-invasive solution
			desired by the team. This means that consumers do not need to replace or modify their existing vents - simply insert the smart vent module behind the existing vent.
